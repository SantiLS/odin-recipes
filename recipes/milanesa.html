<h1>Description</h1>
<p></p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
  <li>330 g thinly sliced round beef</li>
  <li>2 tbsp chopped parsley</li>
  <li>4 cloves of garlic, finely chopped</li>
  <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
  <li>2 eggs</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>
<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Preparing the milanesas</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Season the beef fillets with salt, black pepper, parsley, and garlic on both sides. Stack them on a plate and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a shallow dish, place the eggs, season them, and beat them well. In another plate or tray, put the breadcrumbs. Dip each fillet in the egg and then in the breadcrumbs on both sides. Stack them on a plate or tray.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>Baking the milanesas</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Lightly grease the bottom of a baking tray. Place the milanesas on the tray and drizzle a little oil on top of them. It's easier with the help of a spray, but if you don't have one, a drizzle of oil on each one will also work well. Bake at 225°C with the upper heat (grill) for 3 minutes on each side.</li>
    </ol>
